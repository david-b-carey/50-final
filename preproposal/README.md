# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

- One idea I have would be to build a web-based application taking survey input from freshman users regarding their food preferences for the following week
at Annenberg. This input could then be stored in a database from which the Annenberg staff could contrive meal plans for the following week.
- Another idea I have would be to construct a web-based application to facilitate the ordering of food from local Cambridge restaurants. This application would
store user input in a database and give delivery personell tracks for delivering orders based on housing location.
