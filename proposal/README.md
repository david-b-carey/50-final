# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Better Bites @ Berg

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A website that lets you input your food preferences for the following week at Annenberg (given a list of options) and displays the frequency
of particular responses in the form of a pi chart to inform the Annenberg staff. In addition, it asks students to rank the meals from last week in order
from best to worst, displaying the average rating for the different meals in the form of a bar graph. I could also potentially include a feature allowing
students to submit recipe ideas.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My software will likely mirror finance and survey in forcing a user to register/sign in and it will store responses in a SQL database. This information
will be extracted to create visual representations of the data, which I should be able to figure out by implementing bootstrap/javascript. So, I
will likely link python, html, css, jinja, and java to create my program. And, I will spend more time trying to create an attractive website, potentially
implementing bootstrap slideshows etc.

## If planning to combine CS50's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to CS50, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I will successfully implement everything that I have detailed above and resolve all bugs.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I will create a very attractive website that not only works, but also is very appealing to the eye.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I will manage to put together everything I've learned this semester and create code that could be considered to have very good design.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I will need to figure out how I can logistically implement the data from the database into the bootstrap pi chart and bar graph. I would also like to explore
more bootstrap options to create an attractive site. Hopefully, I can also research/pick up some strategies to improve the design of my code so that it runs
as well as possible.
